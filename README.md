Final Project for LMSC-261 FA '19// 

Mare(a/o) 3D Unity Environment

"Mare(a/o) is the name of my first LP, it means both "tide" and "dizziness". Once the mixes were ready, I sent the 11 song album to several friends involved in the visual arts; they were all expected to choose a song and respond through the creation of an image, video, animation, or text...

Project consists in creating a 'game' where the user is able to experience each song of the album as a room/scene that contains all of the content created by the artists. Additionally, the program asks for the user's mood to determine the trajectory (song order)
