1. What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A) Mare(a/o) Web Page
"Mare(a/o) is the name of my first LP, it means both "tide" and "dizziness". 
Once the mixes were ready, I sent the 11 song album to several friends involved in the visual arts; they were all expected to choose a song 
and respond through the creation of an image, video, animation, or text...
Project: Create a web page for the album that stores all of the content created by this group of artists.
- The web-page should ask for the current mood of the user, and generate an specific song order based on the input 
- The web-page should have one section for each song (11) and a main page for the mood input 


B) Sphere of Life (Jade Family Ball) 
This interesting little sculpture represents the relationship between a son, father, and grandfather; three generations layered in a sphere. 
For the project, I want to create an installation/application that generates a unique melodic sequence for each one of the three members; and an overall composition that
makes sense as a whole (even though each melody is different from the other). 
The program will ask for the input of each family member:
- year of birth ---> to determine scale 
- favorite color ---> to determine the key
- bpm (in rest) ----> to determine tempo 

Result: a composition that illustrates the union between three generations living at differente paces but sharing essence. 



2. Do you have any questions of your own?

A) Mare(a/o) Web Page
- What IDE suits this project? 
- Do I need to pay for a domain? (in case the page actually works)
- Could I use code from an existing page?
- Javascript or Python?

B) Sphere of Life (Jade Family Ball) 
- audio or midi files? (Predetermined sequences for all potential combinations or real time randomness)
- Installation or application?
- If app: Some ux design will be required (what software should I use for this?)
- What language is the bwest fit?
